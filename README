This is an Eclipse project showing basic uses of WebSocket.

*** To test basic request response
Add the project to Tomcat 8 server. Open a browser and enter the URL:

http://localhost:8080/WSTest/

Type something in the text box and hit enter. The text will be sent to the
server via WebSocket. The server will convert the text to upper case
and send back to the client over WebSocket.

*** To test unsolicited event notification

Open a bunch of browser tabs and enter the URL:

http://localhost:8080/WSTest/

In one of the tabs, run the event broadcaster Servlet:

http://localhost:8080/WSTest/broadcast

All the other tabs should show a "Hello World" message.
